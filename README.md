# Non-Emergency Transport Scheduling Application :ambulance:

A web application that aids the process of creating schedules for non-emergency transport.

## Tell me more?

The project is a [MERN stack](https://blog.hyperiondev.com/index.php/2018/09/10/everything-need-know-mern-stack/) web application for non-emergency medical transport. The application allows the operator to manage data about patients, fleet and personnel. That data is then used to plan and schedule trips to vehicles for the day. 

Planned features include:
- Drag and drop planning system for scheduling :white_check_mark:
- connect to google maps api to predict journey times :white_check_mark:
- data validation
- printing the schedule 
- User activity logs
- User permissions

## How do I start contributing? :point_down:

Firstly, lets start with what technologies you need installed.

### Prerequisites

- `Node` needs to be [installed](https://nodejs.org/en/). This allows javascript to be run on a server. The LTS (Long Term Support) version is recommended.

By installing node you also automagically have NPM (Node Package Manager) installed as well. NPM allows you to install packages which help with the project.

- `Git` is also [needed](https://git-scm.com/). Although this is probably a given as you're reading this on a git repository! 

### Installing

Okay, so you have all the technologies needed, next thing to do is download the code and install the packages used from NPM. Let's get started!

The first thing to do is clone the repository to somewhere on your pc. So navigate to a folder in the command line where you want the repository to exist on your pc. Then run the following the command: 

```
git clone https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/ce301_2019/ce301_keep_e.git
``` 

Or if you prefer to use the SSH link, that can be found at the top of this page.

Now that the project is installed on your pc, still in the command line, navigate to the code folder: 

```
cd code
``` 

And install all the packages needed for the server side code: 

```
npm install
```

Once that is all done, navigate to the client folder: 

```
cd client
``` 

And again, install the packages for the client code: 

```
npm install
```

Once that is finished installing all the packages, the project is all setup. Easy Peasy. Commands to run to start the development servers can be found at here.

Finish line! :checkered_flag: You're all set to start contributing! :smiley:

## Where do I find technical documentation? :sos:

Technical documentation can be found in the README files within each folder which explains the contents of everything within the folder. You can start with the [code folders README](./Code) which gives an overview of top level files and folders.
